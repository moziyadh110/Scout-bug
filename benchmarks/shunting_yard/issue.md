`shunting_yard()` in `shunting_yard.py` returns wrong results (or never returns) for some inputs; `test_shunting_yard.py` fails.

Spec:

Infix to RPN Conversion
shunting-yard


Uses Dijkstra's shunting-yard algorithm to transform infix notation into equivalent Reverse Polish Notation.

Input:
    tokens: A list of tokens in infix notation

Precondition:
    all(isinstance(token, int) or token in '+-*/' for token in tokens)

Output:
    The input tokens reordered into Reverse Polish Notation

Examples:
    >>> shunting_yard([10, '-', 5, '-', 2])
    [10, 5, '-', 2, '-']
    >>> shunting_yard([34, '-', 12, '/', 5])
    [34, 12, 5, '/' ,'-']
    >>> shunting_yard([4, '+', 9, '*', 9, '-', 10, '+', 13])
    [4, 9, 9, '*', '+', 10, '-', 13, '+']
